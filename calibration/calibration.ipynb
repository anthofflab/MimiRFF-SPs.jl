Baseline mortality data found in _data/mortality_ was derived from the _death_rates.csv_ provided to the RFF team on October 7th from Hana Sevcikova and available (privately) here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TCYgzRJyt-8wadRcCfxDdpqF84t6oZfj&authuser=hanas%40uw.edu&usp=drive_fs. Column `DeathRate` is the annual deaths per 1000 people. `PopAvg` is the denominator (average between two time periods) and `PopStart` is population at the start of the time interval. Values are average deaths per 1000 people. \n",
